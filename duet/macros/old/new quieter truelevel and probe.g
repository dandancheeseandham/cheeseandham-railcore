;Effect   : Homes, performs 3 bed-levelling routines and probes the bed for information (mesh comp. disabled afterwards)
;Use-case : Time-saving macro, in order to get the bed as level as possible and then measured to check rail alignment.
;NOTE     : you must create a bed-nodrop.g in your sys directory.Copy you bed.g and remove any G1 Z moves to save going up more and probing down.

                         ; twice the dive height. A small dive height will make probing faster, because the Z probe has less distance to travel before reaching the bed.

;         : it will enable the user to easily keep track of their own changes to the default config, as well as provide a simple upgrade path for future Github releases.

; *** WARNING - **Always** make sure your cables are correct, secure and test them thoroughly before homing Z for the first times!
; INSTRUCTIONS :    1) Uncomment your configuration lines
;		    2) M558 *** Do not add the Fxxx parameter for M558 here, it is set in homez.g
;	     	    3) G31 
;		      a) Customize your offsets appropriately, where the probe is X Y is offset from the nozzle.
;		      b) Z is the trigger height (how high your nozzle is from the bed when the probe triggers). You need to dial those in.
;                     c) Tip: A larger trigger height in G31 moves you CLOSER to the bed

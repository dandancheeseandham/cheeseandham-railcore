;Effect   : Larger probe height
;Use-case : Set H and Z to a dive height that you are need for major adjustments and first passes.

M671 S30                 ; Custom M671 setting for leadscrew adjustment - S is the max correction in mm
M558 H30                 ; Set to twice your typical probe height for safety, but you can set this down to 1mm for super-fast probing.
                         ; the firmware moves the Z probe to this height above where it expects the bed to be before commencing probing. The maximum depth of probing 
                         ; from this position is twice the dive height. A small dive height will make probing faster, because the Z probe has 
                         ; less distance to travel before reaching the bed

G1 Z30 H2                ; As this script is for large bed levels, we raise Z to same as M558 for a safe probe.
